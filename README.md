# GxAirCom

This for uses the XCTracer as GPS input source. The XCTracer is connected via BT LE, normal BT functions are deactivated. The module can be connected via serial connection to a Kobo Mini.

ToDo
- parallel to XCTracer BT connection a BT server 
- serial duplex communication to configure the GxAirCom system (maybe from LK800 driver) --> LK8000 support already device priority (XCTRACER, FANET) -> works fine
